 OVERVIEW OF  THE PROJECT:
 
The program allows for basic banking operations such as account creation, viewing account details, depositing money, and withdrawing money.
It manages multiple accounts using an array of BankDetails objects.
Each operation is handled through methods within the BankDetails class, maintaining encapsulation and separation of concerns.
Error handling and input validation are minimal, focusing on basic functionality and user interaction.
This program serves as a simple example of how object-oriented principles can be applied to model a basic banking system in Java.
